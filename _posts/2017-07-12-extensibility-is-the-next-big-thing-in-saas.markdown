Trello sold at $500 million because it was the go-to tool for starting a project. Want to organize ideas for your work/creative live/app/etc.? Just join Trello, it's perfect for that.

And it was perfect for starting ideas. But it wasn't always perfect for finishing them. As projects got bigger, collaboration grew, and businesses kept adding SaaS tools, users moved on to bigger, more powerful products.

This isn't a new story for software. People will always flock to good design and good products, but somewhere along the line they require more power and more customization to fit their needs and that, in a nutshell, is why extensibility matters.

Your product needs to be able to grow, shift and accommodate to what users need over time. Previously, the go-to for building your product out was WebHooks. But WebHooks stopped being the best solution when extensibility became a must-have for every product.

Now, SaaS is looking at ways to ease these problems and get into the meat of what extensibility has to offer. For Auth0 that meant building [Auth0 Extend](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-extend-the-new-way-to-extend-your-saas/), a tool that allows companies to do the heavy lifting of WebHooks to allow anyone to develop on your platform. So today we'll talk about why a tool like Auth0 Extend and the principals of extensibility help you build a better company for your customers, your salespeople and your support team.

## Customizability for customers

You can build a good product, you can even build a great one. But you're never going to be able to build something that will be perfect for every single customer right out of the box. Customers will always want to be able to customize themselves.

When your customer can add on exactly what their marketing team needs, or build a feature that takes your product from good to perfect, they're happier customers that stick around longer. And while you may not be able to build that “perfect-for-them” product, you can empower them to build it themselves.

Slack is a great example of this. Their core platform started for communication, but has come to include a variety of extensions that allow Slack's customers to tweak the product for their needs. There's an app library available, but it's also pretty easy for customers to build their own systems and solutions right on top of Slack with bots, buttons and apps.

Slack's eye towards extensibility is a philosophy that allowed their business to succeed. To keep the same extensible focus means not just thinking about how you build your software, but also understanding what your customers want, how you can incorporate that as your product develops, and how you can make it easy for customers to develop things like that on their own.

With Auth0 Extend, for example, you're taking away all the major roadblocks that customers have from building their perfect custom tool using your product. There's no need for them to figure out servers or scaleability or anything except for what they want to code. They simply need to decide on an addition, write a bit of code, and they're up and running on your platform.

## Superpowers for sales

When your product is built to be extensible, sales get easier. No longer does your sales engineering team need to feel like they can't give customers their all. When it comes to helping customers and potential customers to get the most value possible out of your product, leaving features or add-ons on the table can break a deal. But with an extensible platform, you can build what a customer needs without piling on extra work.

This means that extensibility allows your sales team to say yes more often. When big customers come along and they love everything about your product but they need one key feature, you can build that feature for them. That makes a big difference when you're trying to close a big deal.

Salesforce, for example, is a platform that has survived in large part because the platform hosts a huge variety of apps and extensions. Salesforce is not the world's greatest CRM and perhaps it never was. But having programmers build on top of their platform made it a more appealing and better solution than it would be otherwise. Encouraging customers to program their own customized solutions has given Salesforce continued relevance and longevity.

Having an easily customizable platform can also be a big factor in bringing new users to your product. If a lead is worried they won't *quite* be able to get what they need out of your product, highlighting how easy it is to add features and different extensions that have been built on your product can tip them into the yes pile.

At the end of the day, the magic of extensibility for any and all sales teams is about providing real value to customers. You built your product because you saw that it could offer people a much-needed solution to a problem, and the core of your business is getting customers to succeed. Making it as easy as possible for customers to get exactly what they need from your product is a logical extension of any company's and sales team's mission.

## Transparency for support

It's easier to diagnose and fix customer issues when all of the custom code they're executing for their plugins and integrations is *within the app itself.* The load that your support people have to lift when dealing with technical issues is greatly lessened when the only unknown is the customer's code, and not how they're plugging into your platform.

That means solving problems with customers' integrations gets way quicker.

Extensibility allows you to streamline other parts of support, as well. When your customers come to you with product problems, you can offer custom solutions that fit their needs. Even with a product like Auth0 Extend, you won't be able to solve every customer problem this way. But being able to build new features within your SaaS with relative speed can give customer support more options to support customers.

This can lengthen your customer's lifetime with your product and builds camaraderie between your company and your customers. When you offer a more customized support, you're implicitly telling a customer that you understand their needs and are willing to go the extra mile to get them the most value from your product.

## Extensibility is the new must-have

What customers need and expect out of products has evolved quickly in this early era of SaaS. To keep your product at industry standards means different things with each turn of the technological corner, and right now extensibility is right around the bend.

As we get more and more technology, data and software, the need for custom integration has ballooned. Extensibility as a core of software products gives the flexibility to grow and change more easily with these needs. It also makes sense from a pure business perspective: if you can help a customer create their own perfect product, you should.
